## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take Screenshots**: Use any screenshot tool (Snipping Tool, browser dev tools, etc.)
2. **Save in this folder**: Place all screenshots in the `/screenshots/` folder
3. **Use exact filenames**: Match the filenames referenced in README.md
4. **Optimize file sizes**: Keep images under 1MB for faster loading
5. **Check image links**: Verify all images display correctly in the README

## Screenshot Tips

- Use consistent browser/device for all screenshots
- Ensure good lighting/contrast for visibility
- Capture at high resolution but optimize file size
- Show realistic data/content in screenshots
- Include both light and dark mode versions
- Test on different devices if possible

## Alternative: Stock Images

If you prefer not to take screenshots immediately, you can:
1. Use placeholder images temporarily
2. Create mockups using design tools
3. Use stock images that represent the functionality
4. Commission custom graphics if needed

The README is structured to work with or without images, but screenshots greatly enhance the documentation quality.
